rake aborted!
Could not find MIME type database in the following locations: ["/usr/local/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml", "/opt/homebrew/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml", "/opt/local/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml", "/usr/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml"]

Ensure you have either installed the shared-mime-info package for your distribution, or
obtain a version of freedesktop.org.xml and set FREEDESKTOP_MIME_TYPES_PATH to the location
of that file.

This gem might be installed as a dependency of some bigger package, such as rails, activestorage,
axlsx or cucumber. While most of these packages use the functionality of this gem, some gems have
included this gem by accident. Set USE_FREEDESKTOP_PLACEHOLDER=true if you are certain that you
do not need this gem, and wish to skip the inclusion of freedesktop.org.xml.

The FREEDESKTOP_PLACEHOLDER option is meant as a transitional feature, and will be deprecated in
the next release.
